a flashcard application kind of like anki but better kind of

why is it gonna be better?
- Gamified (make sure the act of reviewing the cards is inherently fun)
- Doesn't punish you super harshly for missing a day (allow taking breaks)
- Actually good default settings
- Actually usable UX
- Clearer grading system
